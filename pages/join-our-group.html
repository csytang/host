            <h2>Ph.D. in Our Group [<a href="mailto:Yutian.Tang@@@@glasgow.ac.uk?subject=Ph.D.%20application--<Your%20name>"  target="_blank">Contact</a>]</h2>
            <p>I am always looking for motivated students who are interested in pursuing a PhD with me.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in pursuing a PhD with me, please drop me an e-mail with your CV, academic transcript and publications (if any). Please mention why my work in particular interests you, perhaps by discussing a paper I have worked on, or a relevant idea you might have.</p>

            <p>Applicants will typically have a BSc in Computing Science or a related discipline at 2:1 level or above, and will have had some exposure to the field of programming languages through courses, internships, or undergraduate projects.</p>

            <p>See <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/" target="_blank">here</a> for information about applying to do a PhD at the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. As part of the application process, you will need to write a research proposal; this is not binding but gives you an opportunity to show that you can read around an area and can identify a problem to work on. </p>


            <h4>PhD study in the UK</h4>
            <p>In UK, a PhD normally consists of 3 or 4 years of independent research under the supervision of a member of academic staff. At the end of this period, you will submit a thesis detailing the work you have done, which will be examined by an internal and an external examiner at a (closed) viva.</p>

            <h4>Funding</h4>
            <p>The School of Computing Science has several scholarships available (for home and international students) each year which cover tuition fees and provide a monthly stipend. The deadline is typically in January each year. If you have interests, please <a href="mailto:Yutian.Tang@@@@@glasgow.ac.uk?subject=Ph.D.%20application--<Your%20name>"  target="_blank">contact me</a> and we can explore oppotunities.</p>

            <p>Please get in touch in good time if you would like to submit an application to our Ph.D. program.</p>
