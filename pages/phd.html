            <h2>Ph.D. in Software Engineering/System Security: Join Our Research Journey!</h2>
            <p>I am always looking for motivated students who are interested in pursuing a PhD with me.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in pursuing a PhD with me, please send me an e-mail. Please mention why my work in particular interests you, perhaps by discussing a paper I have worked on, or a relevant idea you might have.</p>

            <p>Applicants will typically have a BSc in Computing Science or a related discipline at 2:1 level or above, and will have had some exposure to the field of programming languages through courses, internships, or undergraduate projects.</p>

            <p>See <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/postgraduateresearch/prospectivestudents/" target="_blank">here</a> for information about applying to do a PhD at the School of Computing Science at the University of Glasgow. As part of the application process, you will need to write a research proposal; this is not binding but gives you an opportunity to show that you can read around an area and can identify a problem to work on. </p>


            <h2>PhD study in the UK</h2>
            <p>In UK, a PhD normally consists of 3 years of independent research under the supervision of a member of academic staff. At the end of this period, you will submit a thesis detailing the work you have done, which will be examined by an internal and an external examiner at a (closed) viva.</p>


            <h2>About University of Glasgow</h2>
            <p>The University of Glasgow, nestled in the heart of the vibrant and culturally rich city of Glasgow, Scotland, is an esteemed institution with a storied history dating back to 1451. Boasting a long tradition of academic excellence, the university offers a diverse range of world-class programs, attracting students from all corners of the globe. With its historic architecture, lush green spaces, and dynamic urban atmosphere, Glasgow city provides the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable university experience.

            <h2>Funding</h2>
            <p>The School of Computing Science has several scholarships available each year which cover tuition fees (at the ‘home’ level) and provide a monthly stipend. If you have pre-settled or settled status, then you qualify for ‘home’ fees. The deadline is typically in January each year. </p>

            <p>For international students, it is also possible to find funding from other sources; please still <a href="mailto:Yutian.Tang@glasgow.ac.uk"  target="_blank">contact me</a> and we can explore oppotunities.</p>

            <p>Please get in touch in good time if you would like to submit an application to our Ph.D. program.</p>
