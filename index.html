      			<p>Dr. Yutian Tang (Chris) is an Assistant Professor at School of Information Science and Technology, ShanghaiTech University (PI, Ph.D. Supervisor, Co-Appointed Research Professor). He directs the Code Analysis and Testing (CAT) Lab at ShanghaiTech University. He received his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of <a href="https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxluo/" target="_blank"> Dr. Xiapu Luo</a> and Dr. Hareton Leung (Emeritus). After that, I spent two years at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and City University of Hong Kong as a post-doc Research Fellow, with Dr. Xiapu Luo and Dr. Jacky Keung, respectively. He received his B.Sc in Computer Science from Jilin University, under the supervision of Prof. Lan Huang. His research interests include 
                program analysis, empirical software engineering, privacy protection, software testing, blockchain, software component analysis, software supply chain. He is a member of IEEE, ACM, HKCS, CCF, European Alliance for Innovation (EAI), and EuroSys. He is also a committee member of CCF-Technical Committee of Software Engineering, executive committee member of CCF-Technical Committee of System Software and technical committee member of IEEE Technical Committee on Software Engineering.
      			</p>

      			<p>Dr. Tang has published over peer-review papers at premier software engineering venues such as ESEC/FSE, TheWebConf(WWW), ASE, SANER, ISSRE, ICPC conferences and IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE), IEEE Transactions on Reliability (TReli), JSS, IST journals. One work received <span style="color:#CC2900"><a href="./assets/awards/issre.pdf" target="_blank">Best Industry Paper Award</a></span> at ISSRE'18. Three works reported defects in Android OS, which are confirmed by Google Security Team. He serves as an Editorial Board Member for Frontiers in Computer Science journal and Scientific Programming. He also serves as the PC member of over 10+ international conferences such as PLDI, ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ICPC, SANER, CAiSE, EASE, SEKE, MSR, MobileSoft, VaMoS, and the grant reviewing committee member for various projects hosted by Shanghai Gov.
