			<p>Dr. Yutian Tang received his Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the supervision of <a href="https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxluo/" target="_blank"> Dr. Xiapu Luo</a> and <a href="https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cshleung/" target="_blank">Dr. Hareton Leung</a>. He received his B.Sc in Computer Science from Jilin University, under the supervision of <a href="http://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1026/2170.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Lan Huang</a>. His research interests include software engineering (product line; program understanding; testing), blockchain, machine learning (NLP; deep) and empirical study. He is a member of IEEE, HKCS, CCF and EuroSys. 
			</p>


			<p>Dr Tang has published over a dozen of top tier conferences including ESEC/FSE (CCF-A), ASE (CCF-A), SANER (CCF-B), ISSRE (CCF-B), and ICPC (CCF-B) and peer reviewed papers in journals like JSS (CCF-B, JCR-Q1), IST (CCF-B, JCR-Q1). One work received <span style="color:#CC2900">Best Industry Paper Award</span> at ISSRE'18. Two works reported defects in Android OS, which are confirmed by Google Security Team. His future research plans are directed towards advancing the techniques to automatically test apps and locate bugs, and providing tool support for their applications.

				Research Overview:
				----</br>
			For security, we are working on exploring vulnerabilities in Android OS and providing the corresponding Proof-of-Concept attacks. Recently, we found the design defect in the Android App Link scheme (ESEC/FSE'20) and defined the resource race attack model (SANER'20).</br>

			For Android, we target on building practical tools for developers, understanding existing tools, analyzing programming patterns and performance (e.g., ASE'20, ASE'19, SANER'19).</br>

			For software product line engineering, we are working on automatically build a software product line from a legacy software system. We built a series of tools (e.g., Loong, LoongFMR) to assist developers in locating features in the legacy system, transforming features to a new product variant (e.g., SANER'17, ICPC'17, ICEIS'15, SOFTENG'15).</br>
